# Eclipse Setup #

  1. Connect to the SVN repository for this projects
  1. Checkout the main folder in the trunk
  1. All project references should be included when you download from SVN (except for SWT Designer classes)
  1. Download and install SWT Designer (http://www.swt-designer.com). I suggest using the free version after the initial trial ends.
